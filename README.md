indiegogo-scrape


I am uploading two ipython notebook files that i used to scrape all indiegogo projects.

One notebook relates to the code that scrapes all the campaigns and the other is related to the code that scrapes all the project(s) an individual (with a given ID) has backed/followed/created.


Link to download the csv files after running the first code (json format and put back together at one CSV file):

Enjoy and cite my latest work using the same data!

Let me know if I can help kshafi.com
